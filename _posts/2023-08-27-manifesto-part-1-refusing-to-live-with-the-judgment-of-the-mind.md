Everyone prefers a poor quality life today. Almost everyone is living the same style of life like each other’s clone. We accept the impositions brought by the system. We are all born, sent to school by force and receive education. Afterwards, we drift into a working life and run after jobs that are not related to us from morning to evening. In this process, we go to the military, we don’t actually have to, but once the system has imposed on us, we have to do it. We continue to do various jobs and live the lives that others have imposed on us.

When we run after our dreams and realize it, it goes to other people. The reason for this is that they accept the things that the system imposes on it because it is a slave of this system and cannot extract itself from the system. People preferred to be slaves and to be the toy of this unreal system. Just as you read this article, you are living your lives like an insect whose life is lost in this absurd order. Every minute you do everything you try and do not question, you are not different from slaves.

    You deserve to do everything and become a good dog. As a result, your food and water are put in front of you every day. You are comfortable, do not break it at all.

Now I will say; For those who want to take their life away from this ridiculous system…

If you want to exit this system with which you are a slave to this system with your mind. All that needs to be done is to turn to differences. Take your life out of simplicity, retrain it and put your dreams and wishes back on the table; you should see the truth. You will know what you want to do and bring other people out of your life. Until you reach your goal; you will reject the system and come to life with your own free dreams and world. I don’t know what it means to run after other people say something. As long as you go and look at whatever they say, you will be swept away from your mind and stop.

You should free yourself and learn to live your own life properly, not that of others. As long as you stay in the system, you will never have a feature, your own life and thoughts. Therefore, do not do what the system says. Push the boundaries and halt the system. Get out of everything and be someone else. Change your life, do not obey the terms of mind, be free. Don’t get caught up in desk jobs, don’t waste your life. Go and experience whatever you dream of, run after it and do not waste your life in hard work. Enjoy your differences.

    See you on other days when we reject the judgment of the mind…
