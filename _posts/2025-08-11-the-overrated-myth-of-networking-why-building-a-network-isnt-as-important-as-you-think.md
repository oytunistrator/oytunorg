# Introduction 

Every job application is more than just sending a CV — it’s your first interaction with a potential employer. Yet, many candidates unknowingly make mistakes that significantly reduce their chances, even if they are perfectly qualified. Let’s explore the most common mistakes I’ve seen (and sometimes made myself) — and how to replace them with smarter, more effective actions.

**Mistake 1:** Sending the Same Resume to Every Job

Too many applicants use one “master CV” for every role, hoping it will fit all. Unfortunately, recruiters can spot a generic resume in seconds. This approach signals a lack of effort and focus.

**The Fix:** Tailor your resume for each application.

- Highlight the skills and achievements most relevant to the job description.
- Use keywords from the posting — but naturally, not as a word dump.
- Remove irrelevant details that distract from your fit for the role.

**Mistake 2:** Writing a Cover Letter That Says Nothing New

A cover letter that repeats your resume is a wasted opportunity. Worse, some candidates copy generic templates found online without adding their voice.

**The Fix:** Use your cover letter to tell a story.

- Explain why you want this role at this company.
- Share a specific example that demonstrates how you solve problems.
- Keep it concise — one page is more than enough.

**Mistake 3:** Ignoring the Company’s Culture and Values

Applying without researching the company can lead to awkward interviews and mismatched expectations. Employers value candidates who show genuine interest in their mission and work environment.

**The Fix:** Do your homework.

- Read the company’s “About Us” page, recent news, and LinkedIn posts.
- Identify a value or project you admire and refer to it in your application.
- Show that you see yourself as part of their future.

**Mistake 4:** Applying Without Meeting Most Requirements

While you don’t need to meet every single requirement, sending applications for jobs far outside your qualifications wastes both your time and the recruiter’s.

**The Fix:** Be strategic.

- Apply if you meet at least 70–80% of the core skills listed.
- If you’re missing something, acknowledge it and explain how you’re addressing it.
- Focus on roles where your transferable skills can shine.

**Mistake 5:** Being Too Passive After Applying

Many applicants hit “Submit” and then wait in silence, hoping for a call. This is a missed opportunity to stand out.

**The Fix:** Follow up professionally.

- Send a polite email to the recruiter or hiring manager after a week or two.
- Engage with the company’s LinkedIn content to stay visible.
- Keep communication short, positive, and respectful.

**Final Thoughts**

Job applications are not a numbers game; they’re about precision, research, and alignment. A well-targeted application shows employers that you’re not just looking for a job — you’re looking for this job. And that difference can set you apart from a hundred other applicants.
