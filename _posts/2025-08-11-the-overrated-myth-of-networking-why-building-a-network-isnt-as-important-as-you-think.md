We live in a world obsessed with networking. Entire industries are built on conferences, meetups, LinkedIn connections, and “let’s grab coffee sometime” emails. 

The advice is everywhere:

    “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” 

But here’s the uncomfortable truth: networking, as most people practice it, is massively overrated.
# The False Promise of Endless Connections

We’ve been sold the idea that the bigger your network, the better your chances at success. So we chase more contacts, more followers, more “visibility.”

But in reality, most of these connections are:

- **Shallow** — They remember your face but not your value.
- **One-sided** — You remember them because you need something; they don’t remember you at all.
- **Disposable** — They vanish the moment there’s nothing in it for them.

Having a long list of names doesn’t mean you have influence, opportunities, or real support. It means you have a list of people who might recognize you in passing.

# Networking as a Distraction

**Here’s the danger: networking can easily become a socially acceptable form of procrastination.**

It feels productive to attend events, hand out business cards, and grow your LinkedIn. But you might be avoiding the hard, often lonely work of:

- Building deep expertise in your field.
- Creating something valuable and original.
- Delivering results that speak for themselves.

When you substitute activity for impact, your network becomes a vanity metric.

# Skills Outlast Social Circles

Contacts can disappear overnight — people change jobs, industries shift, algorithms bury your profile. But skills? Real, hard-earned competence? That stays with you.

A strong network may open a door. But without skills, walking through that door just exposes you.

In high-stakes situations, nobody hires you or partners with you because they “owe you one.” They do it because they trust your ability to deliver.

# The Trust Equation

Relationships in business aren’t built on small talk alone — they’re built on trust plus value.

Trust comes from:

- Keeping promises.
- Showing consistency over time.
- Demonstrating integrity when it’s inconvenient.

Value comes from:

- Solving problems others can’t.
- Making things better, faster, or easier.
- Bringing ideas and execution, not just presence.

Without both, networking is just name collecting.
# From “Who You Know” to “Who Knows What You Can Do”

**The truth is, you don’t need the biggest network. You need the right network — one built naturally through your work, not forced through constant outreach.**

When you focus on being great at what you do, people talk. Opportunities spread. Introductions happen organically.

The irony? 

The less you chase “networking” for its own sake, the more powerful your network becomes.

# A Better Approach

Instead of asking: “Who should I meet next?” 

Ask: “What can I create, improve, or solve that will make people want to meet me?”

Instead of measuring success by connections added, measure it by:

- Projects completed. 
- Problems solved.
- People helped.

Because when you build something worth noticing, the right people will notice.
# Final Thought

**Networking can be valuable — but only when built on a foundation of trust, value, and competence. Without that foundation, it’s just noise.**

So maybe it’s time we stop glorifying network building as the ultimate career strategy. Instead, let’s glorify becoming valuable enough that the right network builds itself around us.

Because in the end: It’s not what you know. It’s not who you know. It’s who knows what you can do — and trusts you to do it.
