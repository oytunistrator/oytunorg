Time is a moving matter. It is the largest of matter. A core is needed to create time. There is a positive in the nucleus. This positive has been cut off from other times and entered into this nucleus or was forced to break apart by another time period. The nucleus is formed by interacting with the positively empty (neutral) matter. However, this nucleus alone only provides only 1/2 of the movement of the Tar. The bird needs an external negative pole to move.

In an external negative, it was forced to act to destroy the nucleus by another period of time as it would have been disconnected from another time, and a core hit another core to separate the positive and negative poles. Scattered parts form another time. Negative Speed value that provides a rotational speed which is 1/2 that rotates around the nucleus. The positive pole already provides a positive directional movement of 1/2. This two poles rotate to provide 2x speed in time, while on the other hand, at other times, they multiply to one another, they add 2x power in each impact. In this empty nucleus (neutral), where the positives are low, each negative 1/2 rate of time provides the rate of time as much as the negatives. If the positive number is too large, this situation provides a positive direction up to the positive number (1/2 ratio).

This is a situation that decides to go forward or backward in time. In other words, the more positive you have, the more progress you will make; if you have a lot of negatives, it will slow you down the expansion of time and make you move less. Each positive substance creates forward motion; each negative substance creates a slowing effect in time.
