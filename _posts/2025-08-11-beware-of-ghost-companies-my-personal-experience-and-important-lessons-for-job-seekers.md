I want to share my experience working at a company that seemed promising at first but turned out to be anything but professional or stable. It was a classic example of a “ghost company” — a paravan firm with no real corporate backbone. Here’s what happened and what I learned along the way:

**1. The Illusion of Legitimacy**

When I first applied, the company appeared professional. They had a website, an office address, and a friendly HR team. But as I dug deeper, I realized it was a facade. The company was essentially a shell — no real corporate culture, no clear business model, and very limited transparency about who actually runs it. It’s easy to get fooled by a shiny exterior.

**2. Initial Praise and False Promises**

Once I started working, they praised my skills and made me feel like a valuable team member. The atmosphere seemed positive, and they talked about growth, career advancement, and even bonuses. Naturally, I was motivated and invested myself fully in the job.

**3. Payment Issues and Withholding Rights**

Soon, the problems began. Salaries were delayed, and some promised benefits never materialized. When I raised questions, I was given vague excuses about “cash flow problems” and “temporary difficulties.” My rights as an employee were not fully respected. This is a critical warning sign that many overlook.

**4. Cost-Cutting and Attempts to Push Me Out**

As the company’s financial situation worsened, I noticed a shift. They started pressuring me to leave, often through indirect means — less favorable tasks, exclusion from meetings, and increased scrutiny. The goal was clear: reduce costs by forcing employees out without proper compensation.

**5. Workplace Bullying and Unpaid Wages**

The stress of not being paid on time, combined with subtle mobbing tactics, created a toxic work environment. The company failed to fulfill the basic agreement of paying me on time. This was not just unprofessional; it was unfair and harmful.

**6. Broken Hiring Promises**

Everything they promised during recruitment — competitive salary, career growth, a stable workplace — turned out to be empty words. It’s devastating to realize you’ve been misled and that the reality is far from the initial picture.

**7. A History of Disgruntled Employees**

When I researched the company’s background, I found countless former employees with similar stories of disappointment and frustration. This confirmed that my experience was not unique but part of a disturbing pattern.

**What Can You Do to Protect Yourself?**

- Research deeply before applying. Don’t just trust the website or glossy brochures. Look for company registration, financial health, and clear leadership information.
- Check reviews and feedback from current and former employees on platforms like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or industry-specific forums.
- Be cautious of vague contracts or companies that hesitate to share official documentation. Transparency is key.
- Watch out for companies with frequent employee turnover or negative reputations. If many people leave unhappy, there’s likely a serious problem.
- Trust your instincts. If something feels off during interviews or onboarding, don’t ignore it. It’s better to lose a job opportunity than your peace of mind.

**Final Thought** 

Your career deserves to be built on a strong foundation — a company that respects your time, effort, and rights. Don’t let yourself be trapped by paravan firms that look good on paper but offer nothing but frustration and disappointment in reality.

Stay informed. Stay cautious. And above all, value yourself enough to work where you’re truly appreciated.
