## Python Installation

Python is a popular programming language due to its simple syntax and extensive library support. To use frameworks like Django, we first need to install Python on our system.

### 1. Downloading and Installing Python

Follow these steps to install Python:

1. **Download from the Official Website:**
   Download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Installation Configuration:**
   - **For Windows:** Run the downloaded `python.exe` file and check the **"Add Python to PATH"** option.
   - **For Linux/macOS:** Open the terminal and install Python using the following command:
     ```sh
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
     ```
     or for macOS:
     ```sh
     brew install python3
     ```
   - **For Arch Linux:**
     ```sh
     sudo pacman -S python
     ```
   - **For Fedora:**
     ```sh
     sudo dnf install python3
     ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   Check if Python is installed correctly by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

## Django Installation and Project Setup

Django is a powerful web framework used for rapid development. Follow these steps to install Django on your system.

### 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is a good practice to keep projects isolated.

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```sh
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Check if the virtual environment is active. You should see `(myenv)` in the terminal.

### 2. Installing Django

Once the virtual environment is active, install Django using the following command:
```sh
pip install django
```
To verify the installation:
```sh
django-admin --version
```

### 3. Creating a New Django Project

Follow these steps to create a Django project:
```sh
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```
This will generate the necessary files for the project.

### 4. Running the Development Server

Start Django's local development server:
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to confirm that Django is running successfully.

### 5. Creating a Django API

To create a REST API with Django, you can use the **Django REST Framework** (DRF). First, install the library:
```sh
pip install djangorestframework
```
Then, add the following line to your `settings.py` file to enable DRF:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
]
```
Create a simple API endpoint in `myapp/views.py`:
```python
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view

@api_view(['GET'])
def hello_world(request):
    return Response({"message": "Hello, World!"})
```
Finally, update your `myapp/urls.py` file to route the endpoint:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/hello/', hello_world),
]
```
Once completed, run the server and test the API.

## React.js Installation and Integration with Django

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building modern web applications. We can integrate it with Django to create a frontend-backend architecture.

### 1. Installing Node.js and npm

To use React, you need to install Node.js and npm. Download them from:
[https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Verify the installation by running the following commands in the terminal:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Creating a React.js Project

In the root directory of your Django project, create a new React application:
```sh
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```
After completion, your React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### 3. Connecting React with Django API

To fetch data from the Django API in React, you can use the `fetch` method or the **Axios** library. Install Axios using:
```sh
npm install axios
```

Example React component (`App.js`):
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/hello/')
      .then(response => {
        setMessage(response.data.message);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('API request failed:', error);
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This allows your React application to fetch data from the Django API.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully installed Python, Django, and React.js. Now, you can build dynamic and modern web applications by using Django as the backend and React.js as the frontend.
